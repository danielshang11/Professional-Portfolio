# Daniel-Yang-Challenge1

## Description

  The purpose to finish the portfolio is to complete the customer's requirement such as hover function, link functionality and size change. It's from nothing to start, so there is no doubt that is very stressful for me to develop. I actually deleted several times with commits to github which is not a good habbit because if I can track my commit, I can have my memory back regarding to my work-path.
  It's actually harder than lesson, not just one function by one function, but also we have to make it together which is a big challenge for me. However, I went back to see the notes and practice everything.
  Therefore, I've learned a lot from CSS, even through I think I still have a long way to go.

  Notes for myself: Don't forget to practice more about flex function.
